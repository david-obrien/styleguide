When you’re writing content, make sure to measure its readability score. You can do this via Microsoft Word, but there are other tools you can use as well.  

The two most common measurements we use are:
 * Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease – the higher your score, the easier your content is to read. We like to aim for 70 and above, with 60 being the minimum
 * Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level – the lower the grade, the easier your content is to understand. We like to aim for 8 and below, with 9 being the highest

These measurements are based on a formula that considers sentence length and word length. This means they don’t always take into account the context of the word, sentence or page. Use these as guidelines, but remember to use your own common sense as well as feedback from real users.
