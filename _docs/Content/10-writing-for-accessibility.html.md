We want our services to be enjoyed by everyone. This means creating a platform that’s accessible and easy to use, whether a user is colour-blind, dyslexic, using a screen reader or has any other accessibility requirement. 
Using plain English and testing content with a wide variety of users will help improve the accessibility of the platform. However there’s other things you should consider too. 

## Key accessibility principles ##
* Make sure H1s, H2s, H3s etc are used appropriately to structure content
* Avoid directional language that rely on the user being able to see the page – such as saying ‘Use the filters on the right-hand side to narrow your results’
* Avoid writing in all caps
* If an image provides key information - such as an infographic - make sure to give it useful alt text
