Not all content on the GlobalScot platform is long-form articles, web pages and news stories. Sometimes, a piece of content will be as short as a button, notification or error message.

When it comes to writing microcopy, these are our key principles:
* **Concise** – get to the point quickly by cutting out unnecessary words and messaging. This takes less time for the user to read, and fits better into the UI.
* **Simple** – use plain English and simple language to make sure users understand what we’re telling them.
* **Helpful** – where possible, microcopy should help the users resolve a problem or move onto the next step. Instead of just telling a user what’s gone wrong, offer them a solution.

### Getting the information you need

Before you write microcopy, it's important you understand the context of what you're writing. (add more info about questions to ask for different types)
