This guide explains common formatting and grammar guides such as bullet points, numbers, dates and more. 


**Abbreviations and acronyms**
We might use abbreviations internally, but we can’t be sure users will know what these mean. Always question whether you need to use an abbreviation. If you don’t, just spell it out in full each time. If you do, spell it out in full the first time, with the abbreviation in brackets next to it. You can then use the abbreviation for subsequent mentions.

This doesn’t apply to abbreviations that are well known and you can be sure the user will recognise. This could include UK, US, EU, VAT and MP. 

Do not use full stops in abbreviations: BBC, not B.B.C.

**Ages**

Do not use hyphens in ages unless to avoid confusion, although it’s always best to write in a way that avoids ambiguity. For example, ‘a class of 15 16-year-old students took the A level course’ can be written as ‘15 students aged 16 took the A level course’.

**Brackets**

Use (round brackets), not \[square brackets\]. The only acceptable use of square brackets is for explanatory notes in reported speech:
“Thank you \[Foreign Minister\] Mr Smith.”

Do not use round brackets to refer to something that could either be singular or plural, like ‘Check which document(s) you need to send to DVLA.’

Always use the plural instead, as this will cover each possibility: ‘Check which documents you need to send to DVLA.’

**Bullet points**

You can use bullet points to make text easier to read. Make sure that:

* you always use a lead-in line
*	the bullets make sense running on from the lead-in line
*	you use lower case at the start of the bullet
*	you do not use more than one sentence per bullet point - use commas or dashes to expand on an item
*	you do not put ‘or’ or ‘and’ after the bullets
*	you do not make the whole bullet a link if it’s a long phrase
*	you do not put a semicolon at the end of a bullet
*	there is no full stop after the last bullet point

Bullets should normally form a complete sentence following from the lead text. But it’s sometimes necessary to add a short phrase to clarify whether all or some of the points apply. For example, ‘You can only register a pension scheme that is (one of the following):’

The number and type of examples in a list may lead the user to believe the list is exhaustive. This can be dealt with by:
*	checking if there are other conditions (or if the list is actually complete)
*	listing the conditions which apply to the most users and removing the rest
*	consider broader terms in the list which capture more scenarios (and could make the list exhaustive)
*	creating a journey to specialist content to cover the remaining conditions


**Capitalisation**

DO NOT USE BLOCK CAPITALS FOR LARGE AMOUNTS OF TEXT AS IT’S QUITE HARD TO READ.

Always use sentence case for headings. 

Always question whether the word you’re using really needs to be capitalised. Only proper nouns should be capitalised, such as places, titles and names. If a brand name is capitalised, always capitalise it. 

Refer to our word list for guidance around capitalisation of specific words you might use on the platform. 

**Contractions**

We tend to use contractions to make our writing feel less formal and more friendly. So feel free to say it’s, you’re, we’ll etc. 

However, avoid negative contractions like can’t and don’t. Many users find them harder to read, or misread them as the opposite of what they say. Use cannot, instead of can’t.

Avoid should’ve, could’ve, would’ve, they’ve too. These can also be hard to read.

**Dates**

*	use upper case for months: January, February
*	do not use a comma between the month and year: 4 June 2017
*	when space is an issue - in tables or publication titles, for example - you can use truncated months: Jan, Feb
*	we use ‘to’ in date ranges - not hyphens, en rules or em dashes. For example:
*	tax year 2011 to 2012
*	Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm (put different days on a new line, do not separate with a comma)
*	10 November to 21 December
*	do not use quarter for dates, use the months: ‘department expenses, Jan to Mar 2013’
*	when referring to today (as in a news article) include the date: ‘The minister announced today (14 June 2012) that…’


**eg, etc and ie**

eg can sometimes be read aloud as ‘egg’ by screen reading software. Instead use ‘for example’ or ‘such as’ or ‘like’ or ‘including’ - whichever works best in the specific context.

etc can usually be avoided. Try using ‘for example’ or ‘such as’ or ‘like’ or ‘including’. Never use etc at the end of a list starting with these words.

ie - used to clarify a sentence - is not always well understood. Try (re)writing sentences to avoid the need to use it. If that is not possible, use an alternative such as ‘meaning’ or ‘that is’.

**Geography and regions**

Use lower case for north, south, east and west, except when they’re part of a name or recognised region. So, the south-west (compass direction), but the South West (administrative region).

Use lower case for the north, the south of England, the south-west, north-east Scotland, south Wales, the west, western Europe, the far east, south-east Asia.

Use upper case for East End, West End (London), Middle East, Central America, South America.

Always write out the full name of the area the first time you use it. You can use a capital for a shortened version of a specific area or region if it’s commonly known by that name, like the Pole for the North Pole.

**Hyphenation**

Hyphenate:

*	re- words starting with e, like re-evaluate
*	co-ordinate
*	co-operate

Do not hyphenate:
* reuse
*	reinvent
*	reorder
*	reopen
*	email

Do not use a hyphen unless it’s confusing without it, for example, a little used-car is different from a little-used car. You can also refer to The Guardian style guide for advice on hyphenation.

**Job titles**

Specific job titles and ministers’ role titles are upper case: Minister for Housing, Home Secretary.

Generic job titles and ministers’ role titles are lower case: director, minister.

**Links**

Front-load your link text with the relevant terms and make them active and specific. Always link to online services first. Offer offline alternatives afterwards, when possible.

**Lists**

Lists should be bulleted to make them easier to read. 

Very long lists can be written as a paragraph with a lead-in sentence if it looks better: ‘The following countries are in the EU: Spain, France, Italy…’

**Maths content**

Ratios have no space either side of the colon: 5:12

Write out and hyphenate fractions: two-thirds, three-quarters.

Write out decimal fractions as numerals. Use the same number format for a sequence: 0.75 and 0.45

**Millions**

Always use million in money (and billion): £138 million.

Use millions in phrases: millions of people.

But do not use £0.xx million for amounts less than £1 million.

Do not abbreviate million to m.

**Money**

Use the £ symbol: £75

Do not use decimals unless pence are included: £75.50 but not £75.00

Do not use ‘£0.xx million’ for amounts less than £1 million.

Write out pence in full: calls will cost 4 pence per minute from a landline.

Currencies are lower case.

**Numbers**

Use ‘one’ unless you’re talking about a step, a point in a list or another situation where using the numeral makes more sense: ‘in point 1 of the design instructions’, for example. Or this:

You’ll be shown 14 clips that feature everyday road scenes.

There will be:
*	1 developing hazard in 13 clips
*	2 developing hazards in the other clip

Write all other numbers in numerals (including 2 to 9) except where it’s part of a common expression like ‘one or two of them’ where numerals would look strange.

If a number starts a sentence, write it out in full (Thirty-four, for example) except where it starts a title or subheading.

For numerals over 999 - insert a comma for clarity: 9,000

Spell out common fractions like one-half.

Use a % sign for percentages: 50%

Use a 0 where there’s no digit before the decimal point.

Use ‘500 to 900’ and not ‘500-900’ (except in tables).

Use MB for anything over 1MB: 4MB not 4096KB.

Use KB for anything under 1MB: 569KB not 0.55MB.

Keep it as accurate as possible and up to 2 decimal places: 4.03MB.

Addresses: use ‘to’ in address ranges: 49 to 53 Cherry Street.

Spell out first to ninth. After that use 10th, 11th and so on.

In tables, use numerals throughout.

**Quotes and speech marks**

In long passages of speech, open quotes for every new paragraph, but close quotes only at the end of the final paragraph.
Use single quotes:

*	in headlines
*	for unusual terms
*	when referring to words or publications, for example: ‘Download the publication ‘Understanding Capital Gains Tax’ (PDF, 360KB)’

Use double quotes in body text for direct quotations.

Use the block quote Markdown for quotes longer than a few sentences.

**Semicolons**

Do not use semicolons as they are often mis-read. Long sentences using semicolons should be broken up into separate sentences instead.

**Spaces**

One space after a full stop, not 2.

**Telephone numbers**

Use Telephone: 011 111 111 or Mobile: - not Mob:.

Use spaces between city and local exchange. Here are the different formats to use:

01273 800 900

020 7450 4000

0800 890 567

07771 900 900

077718 300 300

+44 (0)20 7450 4000

+39 1 33 45 70 90

When a number is memorable, group the numbers into easily remembered units: 0800 80 70 60.

**Times**

*	use ‘to’ in time ranges, not hyphens, en rules or em dashes: 10am to 11am (not 10-11am)
*	5:30pm (not 1730hrs)
*	midnight (not 00:00)
*	midday (not 12 noon, noon or 12pm)
*	6 hours 30 minutes

Midnight is the first minute of the day, not the last. You should consider using “11:59pm” to avoid confusion about a single, specific time.

For example, “You must register by 11:59pm on Tuesday 14 June.” can only be read one way, but “You must register by midnight on Tuesday 14 June” can be read in two ways (the end of Monday 13, or end of Tuesday 14).
