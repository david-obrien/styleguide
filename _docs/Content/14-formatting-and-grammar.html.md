** Basic numbers ** 

In most cases, write all numbers as numerals except for 'one'. There were 3 people on the team. We met 56 new members. 
Spell out first to ninth, then use numerals - 10th, 15th, 60th. 

There are a few exceptions:
* Use '1' if you're talking about a step
* Use '1' if using our stats component - for example to say 'Number 1 in the world' 
* Common expressions like 'there were one of two problems'
* If a number starts a sentence, write it out in full. 'Thirty-four people came to the event'. This doesn't apply to headings or subheadings
* If using the stats component, use 1st to 9th. '5th largest in the world'

Use 'to' instead of a dash. '300 to 400 people attended the event'.

** Large numbers **

Numbers over 999 should use a comma for clarity: 6,000. 

Millions should be spelt out. 5 million, not 5,000,000. Do not abbreviate to 5m.

Do not use 0.xx million for numbers less than a million. Do not use 0.xx billion for numbers less than 1 billion
Say '600,000' not 0.6 million.


**Fractions, percentages and other maths**

Spell out common fractions like one-half and one-third.

Use a % sign for percentages: 50%

In tables, use numerals throughout.

Use the £ symbol: £75

Do not use decimals unless pence are included: £75.50 but not £75.00

Do not use ‘£0.xx million’ for amounts less than £1 million.

Write out pence in full: calls will cost 4 pence per minute from a landline.

Currencies are lower case.

** Money ** 


Always use million in money (and billion): £138 million.

Use millions in phrases: millions of people.

But do not use £0.xx million for amounts less than £1 million.

Do not abbreviate million to m.

Ratios have no space either side of the colon: 5:12

Write out and hyphenate fractions: two-thirds, three-quarters.

Write out decimal fractions as numerals. Use the same number format for a sequence: 0.75 and 0.45
