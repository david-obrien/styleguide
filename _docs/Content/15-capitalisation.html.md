**Capitalisation** 

It can be tempting to over-use capitalisation. Remember that capitals should only be used for proper nouns such as places, titles, names and brand names (if the brand uses capitals). 

On the GlobalScot platform, avoid using capitals for anything that feels like ‘a thing.’ This means that our platform features (such as the community feed, news & features, dashboard, events and projects) should not start with a capital letter. Roles within the network don’t need a capital letter - such as business member, engagement partner or admin. The term ‘GlobalScots’ should use a capital ‘G’ and capital ‘S’.

DO NOT USE BLOCK CAPITALS FOR LARGE AMOUNTS OF TEXT AS IT’S QUITE HARD TO READ.
