You can use bullet points to make text easier to read. Make sure that:
*	you always use a lead-in line
*	the bullets make sense running on from the lead-in line
*	you use lower case at the start of the bullet
*	you do not use more than one sentence per bullet point - use commas or dashes to expand on an item
*	you do not put ‘or’ or ‘and’ after the bullets
*	you do not make the whole bullet a link if it’s a long phrase
*	you do not put a semicolon at the end of a bullet
*	there is no full stop after the last bullet point

Bullets should normally form a complete sentence following from the lead text. But it’s sometimes necessary to add a short phrase to clarify whether all or some of the points apply. For example, ‘You can only register a pension scheme that is (one of the following):’
The number and type of examples in a list may lead the user to believe the list is exhaustive. This can be dealt with by:
*	checking if there are other conditions (or if the list is actually complete)
*	listing the conditions which apply to the most users and removing the rest
*	consider broader terms in the list which capture more scenarios (and could make the list exhaustive)
*	creating a journey to specialist content to cover the remaining conditions
